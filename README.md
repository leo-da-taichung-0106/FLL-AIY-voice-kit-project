## Introduction       
In order to live, people need food, air, and water. So is the astronauts in space, but there's a factor that has caused astronaut to have bad moods in space, loneliness. Loneliness is an issue that can cause astronauts to not concentrate and cause issues. So my groupmates and I decided to create an assistant similar to Siri but can detect if a person's state is healthy. If not, it reports to the base also using the information the user has filled to make the user better.
